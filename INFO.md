# Passwords Folder

The `data/passwords/` folder is a crucial component of the password manager script. It serves as the directory for storing encrypted password files for each account or service.

## Structure

Inside the `data/passwords/` folder, you will find individual password files encrypted using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. Each password file represents a specific account or service and is named accordingly.

The naming convention for password files is as follows:
```
<data/passwords>/<account>.passman
```
Here, `<data/passwords>` is the path to the folder, and `<account>` refers to the name of the account or service associated with the password file. For example, if you have an account named "example", the corresponding password file would be `data/passwords/example.passman`.

## Purpose

The `data/passwords/` folder acts as secure storage for encrypted passwords. Storing passwords in separate files adds an additional layer of security by compartmentalizing sensitive information.

By keeping passwords encrypted in individual files, it becomes easier to manage and modify specific passwords without affecting the others.

## Encryption

All password files inside the `data/passwords/` folder are encrypted using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. This encryption algorithm is widely regarded as secure and ensures that passwords remain confidential.

To decrypt a password, the password manager script utilizes the encryption key stored in the `data/key.passman` file. It is crucial to keep this key secure and confidential to prevent unauthorized access to password files.

## Usage

When using the password manager script, it automatically interacts with the password files stored in the `data/passwords/` folder based on the user's commands. The script handles encryption and decryption of passwords internally, ensuring data security and privacy.

It is important to ensure the integrity and security of the `data/passwords/` folder and its contents by following security considerations such as regular backups and restricted access to these files.

Please refer to the main README file for instructions on how to use the password manager script and the available command-line options.

## Security Considerations

The security of the `data/passwords/` folder directly impacts the confidentiality of the passwords stored within it. It is essential to keep the following considerations in mind:

- Backup the `data/passwords/` folder regularly to prevent data loss in case of accidental deletion or system failure.

- Restrict access to the `data/passwords/` folder to only authorized users. Regularly review and update user permissions to ensure data security.

- Protect the encryption key stored in the `data/key.passman` file. Guard against unauthorized access to this file as it is essential for encryption and decryption operations.

- Implement additional security measures on the system hosting the password manager script. This can include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular software updates to protect against potential vulnerabilities.

By adhering to good security practices, you can enhance the overall security of the `data/passwords/` folder and safeguard your passwords effectively.
